		<p>Then, these projects are susceptible of being enriched with filtering information. That means that for creating a generic product the user should follow the standard Capella new project creation.</p>
		<h2 id="Defining_the_Variability_model">Defining the Variability model</h2>
		<p>The 
			<b>filtering model</b> supports defining a set of filtering points called 
			<b>features</b>. The filtering model is defined in the 
			<b>FilteringModel</b> element that is created as a child of System Engineering. For creating a FilteringModel right-click the System Engineering model element.

		<p>New features could be added once the user creates the FilteringModel element.</p>
		<p><center>

		<p>The user can also create constraints for documentation. Notice also that FilteringModel is a list of Variability Features so no hierarchical relations could be defined.</p>
		<h2 id="Associate_Model_elements_with_Features">Associate Model elements with Features</h2>
		<p>Each melody element contains a Variability properties section. Double click an element or see the Properties view of a given element.</p>
		<p><center>
			<img width="520" border="0" src="Images/functionalities_associate_criteria.png"/></center>
		</p>
		<p>A feature selector will appear and the user can select the feature or set of features associated with the given element.</p>
		<p>If no filtering features is assigned explicitly to a given melody element, it is still possible that this element could be assigned implicitly to a feature. For example: a Part element of a given optional element or the child of an optional element. This derived property of a melody element is called Implicit Features.</p>
		<p>Also, the action to associate features to model elements is available selecting a melody element, right click, and  </p>

		<h3 id="Using_an_existing_Configuration_for_feature_assignation">Using an existing FilteringResult for feature assignation</h3>
		<p>Users may want to assign to model elements the features that were previously assigned to an existing FilteringResult. A dedicated selector in the Assign Variability Features dialog allows the user to reuse feature selections.</p>

		<h3 id="Automatic_assignation_when_creating_Model_Elements">Automatic assignation when creating Model Elements</h3>
		<p>If the user is modifying the Capella model by adding new elements that will contribute to a feature (or to a given feature selection), then it will be interesting to be able to automatically assign features when creating any model element. First the user should create a Creation Default Feature Set element as child of System Engineering and then select the features in the properties view of this element.</p>

		<p>Once Domain Engineers provide a Generic Model to derive products, then the Application Engineers can use it to extract products based on their feature selections.</p>
		<p>To create configurations first the user should create a Configurations element as child of the System Engineering element.</p>
		<p><center>
			<img width="520" border="0" src="Images/functionalities_create_configurations.png"/></center>
